# Web Design Homework - Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude)

This analysis utilizes HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Pandas, and Python to create a dashboard showing off some visualizations from an earlier weather analysis. The website is operationalized with GitHub Pages, and can be found at https://mconwa20.github.io/. 

In this website, you can find 7 pages, including:
1. A landing page (explanation of the project, links to each visualization page, sidebar containing linked preview images)
2-5. Four visualization pages (descriptive title & heading tag, plot/visualization, paragraph describing the plot and its significance)
6. Comparison page (all visualizations on one page, using a Boostrap grid)
7. Data page (responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations, created using Boostrap & Pandas)

At the top of each page is a Navigation Menu, created using Bootstrap as well, that conveniently links to each of the 7 pages described above.
